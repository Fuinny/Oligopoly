# Oligopoly
Oligopoly is a command-line interface (CLI) game written in C# that allows players to buy and sell shares of various in-game companies. 
The value of these shares is affected by in-game events, which occur at the beginning of each turn. The game is played in a turn-based format.

Please note that all in-game companies and events in Oligopoly are completely fictitious and have no relation to real entities or events. 
They do not reflect the author's point of view on these companies and events, and coincidences are accidental. The game is intended for entertainment purposes only.

This is not a professional project, so don't expect high quality code or regular updates.
