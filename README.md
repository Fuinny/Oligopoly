# Oligopoly
Oligopoly is a command-line interface (CLI) game written in C# that allows players to buy and sell shares of various in-game companies. 
The value of these shares is affected by in-game events, which occur at the beginning of each turn. The game is played in a turn-based format.
This is not a professional project, so don't expect high quality code or regular updates.
