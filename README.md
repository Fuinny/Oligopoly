## :open_book: Description
Oligopoly is a command-line interface (CLI) game written in C# that allows players to buy and sell shares of various in-game companies. 
The value of these shares is affected by in-game events that occur every turn.
The goal of the player is to buy shares of the company and then try to sell them at a higher price in order to increase their net worth.
