## :book: Description
**Oligopoly** is a simple command-line interface (CLI) game built with C#.
In this game, you take on the role of the CEO of Oligopoly Investments.
As the new CEO, your task is to buy and sell shares of various fictional companies.
Each turn introduces new in-game events that can influence share prices both positively and negatively.

**The goal of the game** is to purchase shares at lower prices and sell them when their value increases in order to maximize your net worth.

To keep things interesting, the game features several **game modes**:
* **Random Mode**: Start with randomly generated amounts of money and stock prices.
* **Custom Mode**: Customize your starting amount of money according to your preferences.

Additionally, you can **change or add new companies and events** to the game by modifying **.xml** files in the **content** folder and select your preferred content pack from the settings menu.
If you want to **share** your own content pack, feel free to open a pull request, but **please ensure that it includes only fictional companies and events**.

All contributions are appreciated and welcome!

## :exclamation: Disclaimer
Please note that all in-game companies and events in **Oligopoly** are entirely fictitious and have no relation to real entities or events.
Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.
This includes names and themes that may be inspired by real-world entities.
The game is intended for entertainment and educational purposes only!

Additionally, please be aware that this is not a professional project.
As such, you should not expect high-quality code or regular updates.
